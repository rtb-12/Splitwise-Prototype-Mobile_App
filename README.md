# Splitwise UI Design Project

## Overview
As a practice project, I developed a simple yet functional UI for the Splitwise application using Flutter. This project was inspired by and follows the design outlined in the [Splitwise Redesign on Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/zzwHiavCc5yKRY3pfKKjtP/Splitwise-Redesign-(Community)?node-id=0-1&t=8rZeDl8ahW5wP0OF-0).

## Objectives
- Enhance Flutter development skills by replicating a modern UI design.
- Understand and implement advanced UI/UX principles.
- Gain proficiency in prototyping and design translation.

## Key Features
- **Intuitive Layout:** Follows a user-centric design ensuring ease of use.
- **Aesthetic Appeal:** Adheres to the contemporary visual style as per the Figma design.
- **Interactive Elements:** Includes prototyping features for a dynamic user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter:** For building the UI components.
- **Figma:** For design reference.[Link](#https://www.figma.com/design/zzwHiavCc5yKRY3pfKKjtP/Splitwise-Redesign-(Community)?node-id=0-1&t=8rZeDl8ahW5wP0OF-0)

## Learning Outcomes
- Improved understanding of Flutter and its widget tree.
- Enhanced ability to translate Figma designs into functional code.
- Gained insights into UI/UX best practices and modern design trends.

## Future Enhancements
- **Backend Integration:** Connect the UI with a backend to manage real data.
- **Feature Expansion:** Add more interactive features and refine the existing ones.
- **User Testing:** Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback for further improvement.
